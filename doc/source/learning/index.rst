MassTransit Learning Series
===========================

For many developers, asynchronous messaging is a new pattern. In this series of learning exercises, developers will learn how to create applications using asynchronous messaging with MassTransit.

This series covers using MassTransit with RabbitMQ. The skills, however, are relevant regardless of which messaging transport is used. There are some operational differences between the transports, but the programming interface remains the same.

It is recommended that the learning exercises be completed in order, as more advanced exercises build upon skills that were learned in the earlier exercises.
